\openepigraph{%
The notion of using a modal command-oriented editor may seem a bit anachronistic at first glance, but Vim’s rich feature set and deep extensibility have made it an enduring choice among advanced computer users. It’s still a highly popular editor, especially among computer programmers, Web developers, scientists, and system administrators.

A designer knows that he has achieved perfection 
not when there is nothing left to add, 
but when there is nothing left to take away.

\ldots the designer of a new system must not only be the implementor and the first 
large-scale user; the designer should also write the first user manual\ldots 
If I had not participated fully in all these activities, 
literally hundreds of improvements would never have been made, 
because I would never have thought of them or perceived 
why they were important.
